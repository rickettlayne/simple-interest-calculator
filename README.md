# Simple Interest Calculator

## Description
A bash script to calculate simple interest based on principal amount, rate of interest, and time period in years.

## Formula
Simple Interest = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100

## How to Use
Run the script and provide the following inputs:
- Principal amount (P)
- Annual rate of interest (R)
- Time period in years (T)

## Example
If you invest $1000 at 5% interest for 2 years:
- Principal = 1000
- Rate = 5%
- Time = 2 years
- Simple Interest = (1000 × 5 × 2) / 100 = $100
